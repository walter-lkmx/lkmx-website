## Background

A renowned auction wine house sought to enhance its digital footprint by transitioning from its traditional online auction platform to a more engaging and user-friendly mobile app. Despite having a successful history of online wine auctions, the house's existing mobile app was underperforming—characterized by poor design, slow response times, and a generally unsatisfactory user experience, which all contributed to low adoption rates. The goal was clear: to develop a new app that would not only facilitate easy browsing and bidding on wine auctions but also elevate the overall user experience to meet the expectations of today's mobile users.

## Challenge

The project presented two main challenges: firstly, the integration with the wine house's extensive database to display auction inventory in real time, including detailed wine information such as vintage, region, and tasting notes, along with current bidding status. Rapid and efficient data access was crucial for a seamless user experience. Secondly, the handling of confidential data demanded stringent security measures to protect against fraud and ensure user information remained secure, given the high-value nature of the auction items.

Another key challenge was enabling a synchronized live auction experience, connecting the physical auction event with the live auction in the mobile app. Both needed to operate as a single event, requiring precise real-time updates for bids and event status across both platforms.

In addition, the process for uploading images of the wine bottles needed optimization. The Spectrum Wine team previously had to manually remove the image background before uploading photos, which slowed down their workflow and was prone to inconsistencies.

## Solution

Our approach was to design a custom mobile app utilizing a RESTful API for smooth integration with the wine house's inventory database. This solution ensured the swift and efficient presentation of real-time auction data to app users. To address the security concerns, we incorporated multiple layers of data protection, including the encryption of sensitive information and the implementation of strict access controls. The app featured capabilities for users to create watchlists, contact sellers directly, submit bids, and actively participate in auctions, enhancing engagement and user satisfaction.

To connect the physical auction with the live auction in the app, we developed a dedicated web application for the auction clerk. This tool allowed the clerk to manage bids, control the flow of the auction, and ensure that both in-person and mobile app bidders participated in the same event seamlessly. With this setup, every bid was instantly reflected across both channels, creating a unified and dynamic auction experience.

To streamline the image upload process, Logic Kernel developed a simple but robust application that automatically removes the background of wine bottle photos right after they are taken. A custom-trained LLM-based model was implemented to achieve high-quality background removal, reducing manual effort and improving the overall presentation of auction items.

## Impact

The introduction of the new mobile app significantly improved the wine house's online presence and user experience. By providing a fast, reliable, and secure platform for wine auctions, the app fostered increased trust and confidence among users, which, in turn, led to higher adoption rates and more active participation in auctions. The agile development approach allowed for continuous value delivery and adaptability to the wine house's evolving needs, culminating in a product that not only met but exceeded their expectations.

## Conclusion

The launch of Spectrum Wine's mobile app has transformed the wine auction world, blending tradition with modern technology to enhance the auction experience. This initiative has extended the reach of fine wine auctions globally, reinforcing our commitment to innovative, user-centered digital solutions.
